# Quick Start

This is a deliberately brief [TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr) style overview of the steps you might want to take to explore the contents of this repository. 

The starting assumption is that you have already **set up your [SAP Cloud Platform trial account](README.md#an-sap-cloud-platform-trial-account)** and have checked that you have [access to the SAP Business API Hub](README.md#access-to-the-sap-business-api-hub) with that account, and that you [have a GitHub account](README.md#a-github-account) and have already **forked this repository** to it. It also assumes that you're wanting to **use the SAP Business Application Studio (App Studio)** as [your development environment](README.md#a-development-environment).
